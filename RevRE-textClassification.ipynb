    "### Fine-tuning an LLMs for Real Estate Financial statements text classification task\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "A T12 is a financial statement that breaks down income and expenses of the real estate property over the past twelve months. Each line item is categorized as either income or expense. These reports can typically be obtained from PMSs (Property Management systems). Different PMSs may use slightly different structure / reporting formats. Thus, semantically similar line items may be worded differently. Additionally, T12s could also include multi-level hierarchy which has useful information. This makes it challenging to create standardized reporting across different systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the required complexity, availability of data and considerations for compute costs, we outline 3 different approaches (ordered by complexity). Each of them have some pros and cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a ML classifier (eg. Random forest classifier)\n",
    "BERT \n",
    "LLMs (eg. llama) \n",

    "We have already trained a random forest classifier and have experimented with different parameters to improve accuracy. \n",

    "**BERT** relies on a Transformer (the attention mechanism that learns contextual relationships between words in a text). A basic Transformer consists of an encoder to read the text input and a decoder to produce a prediction for the task. Since BERTâ€™s goal is to generate a language representation model, it only needs the encoder part. The input to the encoder for BERT is a sequence of tokens, which are first converted into vectors and then processed in the neural network. But before processing can start, BERT needs the input to be massaged and decorated with some extra metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "Token embeddings: A [CLS] token is added to the input word tokens at the beginning of the first sentence and a [SEP] token is inserted at the end of each sentence.\n",
    "Segment embeddings: A marker indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token. This allows the encoder to distinguish between sentences.\n",
    "Positional embeddings: A positional embedding is added to each token to indicate its position in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT seems like a good option for text classification given that it is trained on general text data corpus and may capture the context from the hierarchical structure. Since, our goal is text classification BERTs encoder-only architecture would work well for us. Depending on different evaluation metrics from BERT, we can decide if LLMs are worth a shot. \n",

    "Our classification prediction accuracy is ~70%, which we would like to improve. In our attempt using `BERT-base` model we concated the Headers of the each individual line-item we have labeled as income/expense for additional context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach we could try is using `NER` or `Named Entity Recognition`. BERT models can be fine-tuned for NER tasks by providing them with labeled datasets where specific tokens within the text are tagged with their corresponding entity types. Once fine-tuned, the model can then infer entity labels for unseen text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary reason for using NER is that it would encode the entire doc using NER which would teach the model INCOME > EXPENSE section within the document. With the vanilla BERT, we look at each line item individually thus potentially losing out on context from other relevant text in the document. \n",
